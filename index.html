    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry by
        accelerating drug discovery and improving the efficiency of drug repurposing.
        Traditional drug development is time-consuming, expensive, and has a high failure rate.
        AI-driven approaches leverage machine learning, deep learning, and big data analytics
        to identify drug targets, predict molecular behavior, and optimize clinical outcomes.
        This mini project explores the role of AI in drug discovery and repurposing, its advantages,
        challenges, and future potential in pharmaceutical sciences.

<section id="intro">
    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Drug discovery is a complex and costly process that typically takes over 10–15 years
        and billions of dollars to bring a new drug to market. Despite advancements in
        biotechnology and computational chemistry, the success rate of drug candidates
        remains low.
    </p>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a transformative technology in pharmaceutical
        research. By integrating biological data, chemical structures, and clinical information,
        AI enables faster and more accurate decision-making. Companies such as DeepMind,
        BenevolentAI, and dealpha.tech utilize AI-driven platforms to enhance drug discovery
        pipelines.

    <h3>2. AI in Drug Discovery</h3>
    <p>
        AI plays a critical role at multiple stages of drug discovery, including target
        identification, lead compound screening, and optimization.
    </p>

    <h4>2.1 Target Identification</h4>
    <p>
        Machine learning algorithms analyze genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data
        to identify disease-associated targets. AI models can detect patterns in biological
        networks that are difficult for traditional methods to recognize.
    </p>

    <h4>2.2 Lead Compound Discovery</h4>
    <p>
        Deep learning models such as neural networks are used to predict molecular interactions
        and binding affinities. Virtual screening powered by AI reduces the need for
        high-throughput physical experiments.
    </p>

    <h4>2.3 Optimization and Preclinical Studies</h4>
    <p>
        AI helps optimize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties by predicting
        toxicity, bioavailability, and metabolism, significantly reducing failure rates
        during preclinical testing.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="repurpose">
    <h3>3. AI in Drug Repurposing</h3>
    <p>
        Drug repurposing involves identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs.
        AI accelerates this process by analyzing vast clinical and molecular datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI-based platforms rapidly identified existing drugs
        with potential antiviral activity, significantly reducing development time.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI-driven repurposing reduces development costs and improves safety since repurposed
        drugs already have established safety profiles.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Benefits and Challenges</h3>

    <h4>Benefits</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced drug development time</li>
        <li>Lower research and development costs</li>
        <li>Improved prediction accuracy</li>
        <li>Higher success rates in clinical trials</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Challenges</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Data quality and availability</li>
        <li>Algorithm transparency and interpretability</li>
        <li>Regulatory acceptance of AI-generated results</li>
        <li>Ethical and data privacy concerns</li>
    </ul>

<section id="future">
    <h3>5. Future Scope</h3>
    <p>
        The integration of AI with biotechnology, genomics, and real-world evidence will
        further transform pharmaceutical research. Explainable AI models and regulatory
        frameworks will improve trust and adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI-driven personalized medicine and autonomous drug design are expected to shape
        the future of healthcare, enabling faster delivery of safer and more effective therapies.

    <h3>6. Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is redefining drug discovery and repurposing by enhancing
        efficiency, accuracy, and innovation. While challenges remain, the continued
        evolution of AI technologies promises a more sustainable and patient-centric
        pharmaceutical industry.
